# asteroids
A recreation of Asteroids, using graphics, sound effects, and images.

  This game is a recreation of the Asteroids arcade game, written in Java using Java applets and graphics packages. The ship is controlled
using the left and right arrow keys to rotate the ship sprite a few degrees, and the up arrow keys provides thrust in the direction that
the ship sprite faces when pressed. The ship fires a bullet sprite with the spacebar, and has unlimited ammo. The ship maintains momentum
which could run the player into either the bounds of the program window,causing a reset and loss of life, or into one of the randomly
generated floating asteroids.

  The ship's objective is simply to destroy all of the asteroids in the playing field while avoiding collisions with them or the bounds of
the applet, and the game ends when the objective is met or the player dies enough times to game over. Enjoy!
